A super quick and dirty scrubber of a climbing gym bookings that sends push notifications through Pushover on iOS.

Purpose was to get alerted to cancelled reservations that allowed me to book the popular spots ( weekdays 6pm, 8.30pm), 
as they were usually fully booked very quickly the moment they appeared on Monday mornings.

No longer working as the climbing gym changed owners and so did the booking system.
